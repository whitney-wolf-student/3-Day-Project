            <h1><span>âœ°</span> Part 1 : Birth of Video Games</h1>
            <p>The beginnings of video games started in the 1950s through the 1960s. Computer scientists were
                experimenting with designing simple game concepts on minicomputers and mainframes.
                The first ever video game was created in 1962 and was titled <em>Spacewar!</em> and was developed by the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With this, the
                development of games quickly picked up. Consumers could finally get their own video game console in the
                1970s with the release of the Magnavox Odyssey and the first ever arcade games,
                <em>Computer Space</em> and <em>Pong</em>, were devloped and released.
